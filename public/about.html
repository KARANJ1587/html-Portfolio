<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello to everyone There.. I am Karan J. 
  I am a joyful and passionate learner. I have done my school studying in Science.
  I have completed my College in Instrumentation and Control branch. 
  I have great work experience in thermal as well as Hydro Power Plants of more than 10+ years in my Core Branch of Instrumentation and Control.</p>
  I have hands-on experience of working on DCS (Digital Control System) supplied at both the plant sites. 
  Moreover, with the available spares and hardwares, i have manage to develop a control system which controls different parts/ auiliaries of an AC package and water Treatment plant at my site.
<p>
  Apart from the work experiences, i have keen interest in learning and developing things around me.
  Like, i am currently working on Web development projects and AI. 
  It sounds much like very superficial or any sci-fi movie but its a dream like come true if 
  I can develop an AI which is super-capable and a human companion just as J.A.R.V.I.S in Iron Man.

  My hobbies are playing Sports .i.e., Badminton and Painting Art with beautiful colours which add life to any Art.
